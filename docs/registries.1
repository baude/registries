.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBregistries\fP parses a YAML configuration file about registries and has the
ability to output in string or JSON formats.  By default, \fB\fCregistries\fR will

.PP
\fB\-h\fP \fB\-\-help\fP
Print usage statement

.PP
\fB\-i\fP \fB\-\-input\fP

overrides the default configuration file of \fB\fC/etc/containers/registries.conf\fR\&.

.PP
\fB\-j\fP \fB\-\-json\fP
Specifies the output be in JSON format.  The default is to output as a string.

.PP
\fB\-o\fP \fB\-\-output\fP
Redirects the output from stdout to a file. This option is useful when your
program requires its input come from a file (i.e. Systemd Environment files).

.PP
\fB\-V\fP \fB\-\-variable\fP
This option allows you to specify a variable name in the final output.  The contents
of the variable will also be quoted.  It can only be used when writing to
an output file.  For example, a \fB\fC\-\-variable\fR of
\fB\fCREGISTRIES\fR will result in the output format to be like:

.PP
.RS

.nf
     REGISTRIES="OUTPUT"

.fi
.RE

This option is useful for putting the contents into a SystemD Environment file
for use by a SystemD service.
